                  <p>
                    We build assistants around <strong>your exact process</strong> - not templates. Operate by chat when you ask or run on autopilot when you’re busy. Connected to your stack, engineered for reliability and measurable ROI.
                  </p>

                    Repetitive, rules-based work: follow-ups and reminders, meeting summaries and handoffs, lead routing/scoring, report generation, content drafts, invoice/expense processing, data syncs, onboarding sequences – and many more.

    <p>
      We launch when it’s right - not just fast. We stress-test the assistant, fix what breaks, and test again. Only after it passes our QA standard - real-world scenarios, built-in guardrails, and a dry run with your team - do we go live. Quality & stability first, no surprises in production.

                  <p>
                    No. You share SOPs, docs or links; we ingest and structure them, set guardrails, and test on real scenarios. You review and approve before go-live.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Yes. We apply least-privilege access, encrypted connections, and avoid storing data unless required. Wherever possible, data stays in your systems. Audit trails available on request.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You’ll see clear indicators where it matters most—like key tasks completed, hours freed up, and measurable impact on your workflow or pipeline. We provide periodic summaries and review sessions to highlight progress and fine-tune what’s running.
